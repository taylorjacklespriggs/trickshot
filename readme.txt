This game is most easily played with a mouse.
To play the game, you must click and drag your mouse in the grey 'Shooting area'.
The objective is to simply get the ball in the net.
There is a time limit for each level and a maximum number of throws.
The game meets the following requirements:
1. You must be quick and accurate in order to be successful.
2. You have a limited number of throws for each level.
3. Each level is designed to be more difficult than the last.
4. Each level is timed to add difficulty.
5. The player cannot drag the ball outside the shooting area. If they try they will release the ball.
6. The canvas is the main element used, with the addition of a message box.

I know the physics engine is glitchy, but in my opinion it does not significantly affect the gameplay.
